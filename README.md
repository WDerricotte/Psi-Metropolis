Psi-Metropolis is an implementation of Metropolis Monte-Carlo for the purpose of sampling different molecular configurations, written
entirely in python and integrated into the PSI4 ab-initio quantum chemistry package. Psi-Metropolis is made possible by recent work
to bridge together the python and C side of PSI4, spearheaded by Daniel G. A. Smith at Auburn University. I will add more features to
Psi-Metropolis over time as I have a need for them
